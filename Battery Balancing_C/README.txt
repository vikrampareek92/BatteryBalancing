Battery Balancing Algorithm - When three different voltage batteries are
connected in parallel to serve a constant load, than they discharges
unequally, to resolve this, this algorithm switches batteries ON and OFF
for automatically by three switches to keep three voltages at equal
level.


"Battery Balancing" Folder contains five items excluding README,

Step 1 - First check PDF Assumptions and algorithms
Step 2 - Second is Source code file which contains main.c. This 
	 is complete c code(no other file included) and can be complied 
	 for console project on any tool.

I have also included Code block (Windows) project folder and html file 
of document generated by doxygen tool.
